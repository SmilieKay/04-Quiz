# Tron Themed JavaScript Quiz

## Main Objective 
The main objective of this project was to create a timed quiz that asked questions about JavaScript, kept score and took points away if you get a question wrong. I also wanted to make it pleasing to the eye and fun. My main focus was to have a functioning quiz page but I also wanted to have a Tron Theme to it. If you are a fan of the Tron movies you will notice the glowing effect and also many of the questions incorrect answers are Tron quotes and also on the main start page the referral to the getting into the grid and User. I also threw in a Bonus easter egg if you answer correctly in less then a minute then you get a extra 1000 points. A alert pops up telling you , you beat MasterControl. Even if you are not familiar with Tron my goal was to provide a working, enjoyable and aesthetically pleasing quiz.
